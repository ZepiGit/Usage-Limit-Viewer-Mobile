# iOS

The iOS client has a SwiftUI app, a WidgetKit extension and a shared Swift package.
It follows the same quota model and provider behavior as Android, with separate
implementations. The per-provider documents in `docs/` describe payload shapes
and compatibility limits.

## Targets

- `UsageLimitsKit` contains models, parsers, HTTP clients, authentication and sync.
  Its portable code builds and tests on Linux; Keychain and Network-framework
  adapters are compiled when those Apple frameworks are available.
- `UsageLimits` contains the app, system-browser presentation and background work.
- `UsageLimitsWidget` reads snapshots through the shared App Group container.
  It is embedded in the app by `UsageLimits/project.yml`.

## Platform mapping

| Android | iOS |
|---|---|
| Android Keystore and AES-GCM | Keychain with `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly` |
| Custom Tabs and loopback listener | `ASWebAuthenticationSession` plus a Network-framework loopback listener |
| WorkManager | `BGAppRefreshTask`, subject to the system's scheduling decisions |
| Glance and local cache | WidgetKit and snapshots in the shared App Group |

Codex, Claude, Antigravity and Devin use their registered loopback callbacks. The browser
may intercept the callback, while the listener provides another way to receive
it. Codex also has a device-code fallback when the port cannot be used. Grok and
Kimi use device codes; Meta Muse uses the Meta device grant, and Kimi additionally accepts a key from the user's console.
These code paths are implemented, but live account sign-in has not been verified
in the current audit.

## Building and checking

For the portable package, from the repository root:

```sh
swift build --package-path ios/UsageLimitsKit
swift test --package-path ios/UsageLimitsKit
```

The app and widget require macOS with Xcode and XcodeGen:

```sh
cd ios/UsageLimits
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild build -scheme UsageLimits -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

The iOS workflow is configured to test the package on Linux and macOS, build the
app with the real SDK, check the embedded widget and run simulator UI tests.
The Linux `ios/Tools/typecheck-app.sh` script provides an additional check with
framework shims; a pass there does not establish an Xcode build or UI behavior.
The final local audit passed 456 package tests and the app/widget shim type check.
Real-SDK, iPhone/iPad, landscape and large-text CI results remain pending.

See [verification.md](../docs/verification.md) for the observed local results and
remaining device checks, and [release.md](../docs/release.md) for unsigned archives,
distribution signing and release requirements.

## Marketing screenshots

Run the manual **Marketing screenshots** workflow to capture the actual SwiftUI app on an
iPhone and an iPad simulator. The `ios-marketing-screenshots` artifact contains five PNGs and
`CAPTURE.txt` with the source commit and simulator models. The phone captures Overview,
Accounts, Resets and Settings; the iPad captures Overview.

The separate `UsageLimitsScreenshots` test scheme launches a Debug build with
`-marketing-demo`. This uses five synthetic accounts in memory, a fixed clock and a visible
**Demo data** label. It does not initialize shared storage, the keychain, provider clients,
background refresh or notification routing. Settings changes have no persistent store.
Release builds ignore the demo argument and contain no fixtures.

To reproduce on a Mac, generate the project with XcodeGen and choose a simulator destination:

```sh
xcodebuild test -scheme UsageLimitsScreenshots -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=YOUR_SIMULATOR_UDID' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

The workflow shows the complete commands for exporting the XCTest screenshot attachments
as named PNGs. `ios/Tools/typecheck-app.sh -D DEBUG` also checks the fixture branch against
the Linux framework shims; the simulator workflow is the real SDK and rendering check.
