/// the system browser instead would background the app, and a suspended app does not accept

    /// backgrounding the app to fetch a code from Messages. But whether Apple honours `http`
    /// there is not documented, and a sign-in that depends on undocumented behaviour is a
    /// sign-in that breaks on an OS update.
