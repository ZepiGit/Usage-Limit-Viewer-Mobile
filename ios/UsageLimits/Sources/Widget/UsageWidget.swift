//
//  Two invariants govern everything below:
//
//  1. A widget cannot tick. It re-renders only when WidgetKit asks it to, so
//     nothing shown is phrased relative to "now": resets are absolute clock times,

//  2. The tile may state only what the cache states. An unknown percentage is an
//     em dash over an empty bar — never a 0 % or a 100 % invented for the occasion.
