/// An iOS app can bind and accept on loopback: the local-network permission governs the LAN and
/// Bonjour, not 127.0.0.1, so no usage description and no entitlement are required. What makes
/// this work at all is that the browser is `ASWebAuthenticationSession`, which presents in-process
/// — the app stays foregrounded and the socket stays alive while the user signs in. Sending them
/// to the system browser would background the app, and a suspended app does not accept
/// connections.
///
/// The rules this enforces, each because the alternative is worse than a failed sign-in:
///
/// - Bound to 127.0.0.1 explicitly, NEVER to all interfaces. A listener on 0.0.0.0 offers the
///   authorisation code to anything that can route to the device.
/// - One answer, then closed. The port is not left open after the code arrives.
/// - A deadline, so a sign-in the user abandoned does not leave a socket bound for the life of
///   the process.
/// - Nothing is read beyond a bounded request, and only the request line is parsed.
