/**
 * Repaints the widgets at the next moment their PRESENTATION changes on its own.
 *
 * The sync worker fetches new data and network-constrains itself accordingly, but two visible
 * transitions do not need the network and were not covered by any event: a cached snapshot
 * crossing its staleness threshold, and a cached reset instant arriving. Neither moves the
 * Room cache, so the data-driven observe flow never re-emits, and a healthy-looking tile
 * stayed healthy-looking for as long as nothing else happened to run — exactly offline, which
 * is when "as of when?" matters most. This worker exists to cross those boundaries: it reads
 * only the local cache, repaints, and schedules the next boundary. No network constraint, no
 * credentials, no polling loop, no exact alarm — WorkManager may defer it, which is why the
 * views also age every timestamp themselves when they do render.
 *
 * A reset boundary is the one case a cache-only repaint cannot get right: the number the
 * provider now reports is not in the cache. So after repainting — the rows concerned now
 * read "reset due" rather than a spent figure in a confident colour — this asks for a sync,
 * through the same aged-cache check the system's widget tick uses, so the confirmation
 * arrives as soon as the network allows.
