/**
 * Turns the Codex `/backend-api/wham/usage` payload into normalised windows.
 *
 * The payload nests three families of limit, each with a `primary_window` and a
 * `secondary_window`:
 *
 *  - `rate_limit` — ordinary Codex usage
 *  - `code_review_rate_limit` — code review, metered separately
 *  - `additional_rate_limits[]` — named extras that appear and disappear per plan
 *
 * Windows are classified by their declared `limit_window_seconds`, not by whether they sit in
 * the primary or secondary slot. Upstream puts a monthly window in the secondary slot for
 * team plans and a weekly one for individual plans, so trusting the position would label a
 * month as a week. Position is used only as a fallback for legacy payloads that omit the
 * duration entirely.
