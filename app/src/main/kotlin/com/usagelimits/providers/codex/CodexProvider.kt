/**
 * OpenAI Codex / ChatGPT subscription.
 *
 * Login is the authorization-code flow the Codex CLI itself runs: sign in on the provider's
 * page, get redirected to `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`, done — the same shape as
 * Claude and Antigravity, on the same [LoopbackServer]. The device flow, which was the only
 * one for a while, stays as the fallback for the one thing the browser flow needs and cannot
 * guarantee: the registered port being free. It asks the user to carry a code from this app
 * into the browser, which is exactly the step the browser flow removes.
 *
 * One wrinkle in the fallback: OpenAI's device endpoint returns the PKCE verifier *and*
 * challenge alongside the authorization code, so the app exchanges a pair it did not
 * generate. The verifier still never crosses an untrusted channel, but it means PKCE there is
 * not the client-binding guarantee it normally is — noted in the research doc. The browser
 * flow generates its own pair, as PKCE intends.
