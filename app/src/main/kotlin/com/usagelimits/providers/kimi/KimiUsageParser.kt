/**
 * Reads Kimi Code's `GET /coding/v1/usages`.
 *
 * The response carries two kinds of window, and — this is the part worth knowing — they report
 * consumption in OPPOSITE terms:
 *
 *   - the weekly block under `usage` has `limit` and `used`, and never `remaining`
 *   - each entry in `limits[].detail` has `limit` and `remaining`, and never `used`
 *
 * Reading only `remaining` therefore computes nothing at all for the weekly window, which
 * renders as an untouched bar on an account that has spent its whole week. That is a real
 * defect other clients shipped and later fixed; this parser takes either field from the start
 * and derives the percentage from whichever one is present.
