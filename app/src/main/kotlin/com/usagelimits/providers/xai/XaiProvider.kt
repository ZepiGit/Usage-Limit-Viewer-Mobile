/**
 * xAI / Grok subscription.
 *
 * Login is the RFC 8628 device authorization grant, which is the best fit for this provider
 * on a phone: there is no redirect, so no loopback port to bind and nothing to survive the app
 * being backgrounded while the browser is open. The user types a short code on x.ai and the
 * app polls.
 *
 * Endpoints are not hardcoded — they come from xAI's OIDC discovery document. That is a
 * document fetched over the network, so both endpoints it names are checked against
 * [validateEndpoint] before a single byte is sent to them: a tampered or stale discovery
 * response must not be able to redirect token traffic to a host of its choosing.
