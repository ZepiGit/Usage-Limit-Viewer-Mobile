 * A provider's raw plan string, as a subscriber would recognise it.

 * Providers disagree about case. Anthropic hands back `default_claude_max_5x`; OpenAI hands
 * back a bare `plus`. Until this existed the Codex path passed its value straight through, so
 * an account read "OpenAI Codex plus" while the Claude beside it read "Claude Max 5×".
 *
 * Read structurally rather than from a table of known tiers, for the reason Claude's tier
 * parsing already gives: vendors add tiers, and a table renders a new one as no plan at all.
 * An unrecognised tier still yields something readable.
 *
 * `Char.uppercase()` is the full Unicode mapping rather than the single-character one — 'ß'
 * has no single-char uppercase, so `replaceFirstChar` leaves it alone where the Swift twin
 * produces "SS". Matching Swift is what keeps the two apps showing the same string.
