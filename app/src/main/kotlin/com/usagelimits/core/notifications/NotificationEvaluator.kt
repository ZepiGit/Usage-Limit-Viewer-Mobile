/**
 * Decides what a completed sync should say, without touching Android.
 *
 * Every notification here is an *edge*: something that just became true. Re-deriving that from
 * the current snapshot alone is impossible — a snapshot says an account is at 8 %, not whether
 * it was already at 8 % an hour ago — so the evaluator takes the prior state in and hands the
 * new state back. Keeping that pure is what makes the deduplication testable at all; the
 * Android side does nothing but persist the claims and post the lines.
 *
 * The contract callers must honour, and the reason it is shaped this way:
 *
 *  - Claims are consumed **before** the notification is posted. A Room transaction cannot
 *    commit atomically with `NotificationManager.notify`, so one of the two failure modes has
 *    to be chosen. Losing an alert to a crash in that gap is recoverable; repeating one every
 *    fifteen minutes is what makes a user turn notifications off.
 *  - State advances even when notifications are disabled or permission is missing. Otherwise
 *    granting permission would replay every threshold the account has ever crossed.

     * window in the snapshot keeps the stable spelling, and only a colliding group falls back
     * to appending the id. Windows that alias may re-arm if the provider renumbers them, which
     * is a repeated notification; not disambiguating them means silence about an exhausted
