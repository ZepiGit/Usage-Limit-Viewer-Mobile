/**
 * Turns a completed sync into at most one notification.
 *
 * Two rules keep this from becoming spam. Every finding across every account is folded into a
 * single grouped notification posted to a stable id, so a later sync replaces the previous one
 * instead of stacking. And edge-triggered alerts — crossing a threshold, a reset drawing near,
 * a credit about to lapse — are claimed in the database before they are posted, so a limit the
 * user has already been told about stays quiet on the next sync.
 *
 * Claiming before posting is deliberate. A database write cannot commit atomically with
 * `NotificationManager.notify`, so one of two failures has to be chosen: an alert lost to a
 * crash in the gap, or an alert repeated every fifteen minutes. The first is recoverable; the
 * second is what makes people switch notifications off.
