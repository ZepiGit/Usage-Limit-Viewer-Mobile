 * Refreshes usage for accounts.

 * Three properties matter here:
 *
 *  - **Isolation.** Accounts sync concurrently and each failure is caught per account, so one
 *    revoked token or one provider outage cannot stop the others from updating.
 *  - **Refresh safety.** Token refreshes are serialised per credential reference. Without
 *    that, a periodic sync racing a manual pull-to-refresh could both refresh the same
 *    account, and providers invalidate the old refresh token on use — the loser would be left
 *    holding a dead token and the account would appear revoked.
 *  - **Stale over empty.** A failed fetch keeps the previous numbers and records the error, so
 *    the UI can say "last updated 37 minutes ago, refresh failed" instead of blanking a card.
