/**
 * Background usage refresh.
 *
 * Runs the same [SyncEngine] the UI uses, then pushes the refreshed cache into the widgets.
 * A pass where *some* accounts succeeded returns success — [SyncEngine] already recorded each
 * per-account error, and asking WorkManager to retry would double the request rate against a
 * provider that is already failing. A periodic pass where *every* account failed returns retry,
 * since that points at a shared cause (offline, or the device asleep) worth backing off and
 * retrying sooner than the next period.
 *
 * A one-shot pass never asks for a retry. It is enqueued under one unique name with
 * [ExistingWorkPolicy.KEEP], so a retrying one-shot sitting in WorkManager's backoff queue
 * swallowed every later trigger — app start, `onResume`, the widget's refresh button — for as
 * long as the backoff lasted. The user tapped refresh and nothing happened. The failure is
 * already recorded against each account; the next trigger should simply run.
