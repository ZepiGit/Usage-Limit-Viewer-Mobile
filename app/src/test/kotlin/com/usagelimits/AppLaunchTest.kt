/**
 * Does the app start?
 *
 * The question no parser test can answer, and the one a user asks first. It found a real fault
 * the moment it was written: the app relied on WorkManager's default `InitializationProvider`,
 * a content provider that runs before `Application.onCreate` and is invisible from everywhere.
 * When it does not run, `WorkManager.getInstance` throws inside a `SupervisorJob`, nothing
 * crashes, nothing is logged, and the background refresh simply never happens for the life of
 * the install — while every screen keeps saying the data is current.
 *
 * Initialisation is now declared by the Application itself, which is what makes it both
 * deterministic and reachable from here.
