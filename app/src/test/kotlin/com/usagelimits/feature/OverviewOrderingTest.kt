/**
 * Two things the overview screen was getting wrong about what to show first.
 *
 * The list was sorted by `Severity.ordinal`, whose declaration order puts STALE and ERROR
 * after EXHAUSTED because they are worse *states* — so a never-fetched blank card and a
 * day-old stale card sat above the account the user had actually run out on, on the one
 * screen that promises "the account that needs attention is the one already on screen".
 * The widget had its own, correct ranking; now both use `Severity.urgency`.
 *
 * And "Next reset" took the minimum over every window's reset instant, past ones included.
 * A snapshot keeps an expired instant until the next fetch replaces it, so once any window
 * had rolled over the card read "now" for hours while the real next rollover never showed.
