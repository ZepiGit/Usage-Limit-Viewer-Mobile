/**
 * What a window reports when the arithmetic behind it went wrong.
 *
 * A provider stating a limit of zero, or a payload carrying a literal NaN, produces a non-finite
 * percentage. The clamp does not catch one — NaN compares false against every bound, so
 * `coerceIn` hands it straight back — and every consumer downstream then renders or ranks a
 * number that is not one.
 *
 * The iOS twin refuses these for the same reason, and the consequence there is worse: Swift's
 * `Int(_:)` traps on a non-finite value where Kotlin's `toInt()` saturates, and it does so inside
 * a widget extension, where a trap is a blank tile with no diagnostic anywhere.
