/**
 * The two decisions the sync worker makes without touching the network.
 *
 * Whether to ask WorkManager for a retry: only a periodic pass in which every account failed.
 * A one-shot that retried sat in the backoff queue under its unique name with KEEP, and every
 * later trigger — app start, `onResume`, the widget's refresh button — was dropped for as long
 * as the backoff lasted. The user tapped refresh and nothing happened.
 *
 * Whether a clock-driven trigger should fetch at all: only when the cache has aged past the
 * user's interval, or a window has reset since its snapshot was taken. The system's widget
 * tick also fires on placement and resize, and neither should cost a provider round trip a
 * minute after the last one.
