/**
 * What the credential store does when the disk says no.
 *
 * These paths decide whether an account survives, and none of them could be run before:
 * `AndroidKeyStore` is not a provider a JVM test has, so the store was reachable only on a
 * device. The cipher is now injectable — for this reason and no other — while the default
 * stays the real Keystore one, so nothing here can accidentally certify a weaker cipher than
 * production uses.
 *
 * The stake is specific. Every provider this app talks to rotates the refresh token when it is
 * used, so the moment a refresh succeeds the token on disk is dead. A write that fails without
 * saying so leaves the dead one there and the live one in memory only: the sync that just ran
 * still works, and the next launch has an account that can never authenticate again.
