# Image sources and rendering scope

## Original Terracotta design

The original `app-icon.png`, platform badges, `devices.png`, `widgets.png` and individual
device assets have been copied without changes from the first Terracotta package. These
were source-based illustrations, not native app screenshots. The three device shells remain
visible; an iPad screenshot is not relabelled as an Android foldable.

## Added widget illustrations

These are deterministic SVG/PNG reconstructions, not images of a running Android or iOS
widget. No image-generation model was used for them. They reproduce the source-defined
component hierarchy, field choices, spacing where explicit, palette and provider artwork.
Text rasterisation, automatic measurement, system margins and launcher-specific sizing have
not been validated pixel-for-pixel against a native host. Label them as source-based
illustrations. The editorial panels and captions sit outside the
illustrated widget boundaries.

In particular, Mini Rings retain their logo-only content. Account labels were not invented
inside this widget. Summary instances are identified by external captions. iOS ring labels
use the title field, not Android-only labels. Legacy iOS tiles are not described as account-
configurable. Transparent-widget backgrounds are illustrative backdrops, not wallpaper captures.

Synthetic data: `demo-accounts.json`. Four separate local identities: Codex Personal / Work
and Claude Personal / Work. Data values are shared consistently between illustrations.

## Original native screenshots in the app tour

The five PNG files in `screenshots/` are copied unchanged from the GitHub Actions artifact
`ios-marketing-screenshots`, run `34712814242`, artifact `10303876932`. Capture commit:
`abc43759b19bcc59894b9ab055fec358916e1065`, 12 September 2026. The archive's `CAPTURE.txt` is
included. Screens use synthetic demo accounts, not live credentials; they precede the widget
source inspected for this README. The tour does not call a provider and does not fabricate
additional native screens. A generic phone frame surrounds the screenshots without
retouching the files.

## Native verification

No Android emulator, WidgetKit host or physical phone was run for this documentation task.
The local browser rendering and tour navigation were tested separately; they do not establish
native app correctness or foldable hardware compatibility.
