# Architecture

The whole app is one idea repeated at every level: whatever a provider hands back, turn it
into the same small set of normalised types as early as possible, and let everything above
that point be provider-agnostic. A screen never asks "which provider is this?" to decide how
to draw a bar, and a widget never learns that Antigravity reports a remaining *fraction* while
Codex reports a consumed *percent*.

## Layers and dependency direction

Everything lives in a single Gradle module under `com.usagelimits`, with the package structure
carrying the layering:

```
core/model      Kotlin models; reconnect-message constant reference, no Android framework
core/network    HttpClient, JsonSupport, ProviderException, ProviderEndpoints
core/auth       OAuthCredentials, CredentialStore, KeystoreCredentialStore
core/oauth      Pkce, JwtClaims, LoopbackServer
core/time       Instants, Countdown
core/database   Room entities, DAOs, UsageRepository
core/settings   SettingsStore (DataStore)
core/sync       SyncEngine, SyncWorker, NotificationPublisher
core/di         AppContainer
providers/      UsageProvider + one package per provider (provider + parser)
feature/        ViewModels and Compose screens
ui/             theme, shared components, adaptive layout helpers
widget/         Glance widgets and the reducer that feeds them
navigation/     the app shell
```

The dependency rule is that arrows point *down* this list, and it holds where it matters:

- `Severity`, `WindowCategory` and window arithmetic have no Android or serialization
  dependency and remain testable in plain JVM tests. `ConnectionStatus` has one narrow
  cross-package dependency: it references the compile-time reconnect-message constant owned
  by `NotificationEvaluator`, rather than maintaining a second current message literal.
  The older persisted wording remains an explicit compatibility fallback.
- `providers/` depends on `core/` and on nothing above it. A provider cannot reach a screen,
  a widget, or the database.
- `widget/` has no import of `core.auth` and no import of `providers` — the point of
  §"Two stores" below, and a property you can re-verify with one grep. What it does import is
  `core.model`, `core.time.Countdown`, `core.database` (`AccountUsage`, `WidgetConfigEntity`),
  `core.sync.SyncWorker` and `ui/`, plus `MainActivity` for the tap target and
  `providerSymbol`/`providerTint` from `feature/overview` so a tile and a card cannot disagree
  about a provider's glyph or colour — a third upward edge, and the least defensible of them.

Two edges deliberately point back up, and both are at the composition seam rather than inside
a layer:

- `core/sync/SyncEngine` and `core/di/AppContainer` import `providers.ProviderRegistry`. The
  alternative — a registry interface in `core` implemented in `providers` — buys an indirection
  that no second implementation would ever use.
- `core/sync/SyncWorker` imports `widget.WidgetUpdater`, because "the cache moved, wake the
  widgets" has to be expressed somewhere and the worker is where the pass ends.

There is one genuine leak worth naming: `feature/accounts/AddAccountViewModel` imports
`CodexProvider` to call `displayCode()`, because Codex packs a user code and a device id into
one challenge field and only Codex knows how to split it again. It is a small wart. The clean
fix is for `LoginChallenge.DeviceCode` to carry the displayable code separately from whatever
opaque state the provider needs to carry forward, and that is what should happen the next time
a device-flow provider is added.

## The `UsageProvider` abstraction

`UsageProvider` is the contract that keeps provider JSON out of the app:

```kotlin
interface UsageProvider {
    val providerId: ProviderId
    suspend fun beginLogin(): LoginChallenge
    suspend fun completeLogin(challenge: LoginChallenge, redirectResponse: String? = null): OAuthCredentials
    suspend fun refresh(credentials: OAuthCredentials): OAuthCredentials
    suspend fun fetchProfile(credentials: OAuthCredentials): ProviderProfile
    suspend fun fetchUsage(account: ProviderAccount, credentials: OAuthCredentials): UsageResult
    val supportsResetCredits: Boolean get() = false
    suspend fun consumeResetCredit(account: ProviderAccount, credentials: OAuthCredentials)
}
```

Read it for what is absent as much as for what is present. There is no `complete()`, no
`chat()`, no `send()`. The interface cannot express an inference request, which is the
structural version of the promise the README makes in prose.

Each implementation owns every provider-specific detail — endpoint, headers, payload shape,
the non-standard way OpenAI signals "still pending", the fact that Anthropic's token endpoint
wants JSON rather than form encoding — and hands back only `UsageResult`, which is a list of
`UsageWindow` plus a list of `ResetCredit`. Parsing is split into a separate object per
provider (`CodexUsageParser`, `ClaudeUsageParser`, `AntigravityQuotaParser`,
`XaiBillingParser`) that is pure Kotlin over a `JsonObject`, so the interesting half of each
provider is unit-testable without an HTTP stack or an Android runtime.

**Why the UI never sees provider JSON.** If a screen could reach a raw payload it would
eventually branch on one — "if this is Antigravity, divide by 100" — and that branch would
then be duplicated in the widget, and the two would drift. Because the boundary is a data
type rather than a convention, the drift is impossible: `OverviewScreen` receives
`UsageWindow`s and has no way to ask what shape they arrived in. It also means adding a fifth
provider is one new package plus one line in `ProviderRegistry`, with no screen or widget
change at all.

Parsers are defensive by policy. Every field lookup goes through `JsonSupport`'s vararg
accessors, which accept snake_case and camelCase spellings alike, unknown keys are ignored,
and a window that cannot be understood is dropped rather than rendered from an assumed zero.
An upstream rename costs one row, not a failed sync.

## The normalised model

Five types carry everything, and each exists for a reason.

**`ProviderAccount`** is identity, keyed by `provider + externalAccountId` rather than by
e-mail — the same address can back several accounts and an address can change while the
account does not. It carries a `credentialReference`, which is a *name* for an entry in the
credential store rather than a credential; that is the seam the whole security story hangs
from. Provider-specific extras that are not secret (the Antigravity GCP project id, the
ChatGPT account id header value) live in a small `attributes` map so a provider can stash
what it needs without the model growing a per-provider field.

**`UsageWindow`** is one bar. It stores normalized `usedPercent` (0–100 consumed) and derives `remainingPercent`.
Provider adapters convert remaining fractions and amount/capacity pairs at this boundary.
Missing or invalid percentages remain unknown. Display rounding cannot turn a positive
remainder into zero or a partially used quota into 100%. `scope` distinguishes global
constraints from model/feature pools and limits whose scope is unknown. The
`category` — `FIVE_HOUR`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, `OTHER` — is computed from the declared window
*duration*, never from the window's position in the payload, because upstream puts a monthly
window in the "secondary" slot on team plans. `OTHER` is a real, renderable outcome: an
unrecognised window is shown with whatever label the provider gave it rather than being forced
into the wrong bucket or dropped.

**`UsageSnapshot`** is one fetch for one account: when, whether it worked, the windows, and any
reset credits. Its `status` distinguishes `OK`, `PARTIAL` and `FAILED`, and — this is the part
that matters for the feel of the app — a `FAILED` snapshot keeps the *previous* windows. The
screen then says "updated 37 minutes ago, refresh failed" instead of going blank, which is both
more useful and more honest.

**`ResetCredit`** models the one genuinely consumable thing any provider exposes: a Codex
rate-limit reset. Only credits that are both of the Codex type and reported as available are
modelled, and `supportsResetCredits` is false everywhere else — the app does not invent a
concept a provider does not have.

**`Severity`** uses shared thresholds: above 50% healthy, above 20% medium,
above zero low, and zero exhausted. Unknown measurements have `UNKNOWN` severity;
failed fetches remain errors. Global blocking windows govern account availability.
Exhausted model or feature pools produce `LIMITED` while other pools remain available,
and keep their names on the detail rows. `PARTIAL` fetch warnings are displayed separately
from measured percentages. Summary selection prefers global constraints; it does not
average independent pools. Staleness is evaluated against the configured sync interval.

A failed refresh preserves `fetchedAt`, the age of the last successful measurement, and
advances `lastAttemptAt`. Room migration 9→10 adds that nullable timestamp without replacing
accounts or widget settings. Window JSON carries scope; legacy cache rows infer only known
provider identities and preserve unknown future scopes conservatively.

## Two stores, and why widgets can only reach one

Credentials and cache are separated by design, not by convention:

- **`KeystoreCredentialStore`** holds OAuth credentials, encrypted with an AES-GCM key that
  lives in the Android Keystore and cannot be exported. Ciphertext goes to a private
  `SharedPreferences` file. Keys are `cred_<credentialReference>`.
- **Room** (`usage_limits.db`) holds account metadata, one usage snapshot per account, and
  per-widget configuration. By construction there is no column anywhere that could contain a
  token — `AccountEntity` stores the credential *reference*, and the snapshot table stores
  normalised windows serialised as JSON.

The consequence is that reading the entire database tells an attacker how much Claude quota
you have left and nothing else. That is what makes it safe to let widgets read it directly:
`WidgetUpdater` goes through `UsageRepository` only, `WidgetDataBuilder` is a pure function
over already-loaded `AccountUsage` values, and the `widget` package does not import
`core.auth` at all. A token cannot reach the launcher process because there is no call chain
that would carry one there — see `docs/widgets.md` for the full path.

Backups and device transfer are disabled for both stores (`allowBackup="false"` plus
exclude-everything data extraction rules). Keystore-wrapped ciphertext would be useless after
a restore anyway, and the usage cache is re-derived on the next sync.

   core/sync/SyncWorker  (WorkManager) -+  a normal sync pass
```

**Who touches `core/auth`, and why it is three callers rather than one.**
`SyncEngine.validCredentials` is the only code that *loads* a credential. Every request-time
use of a token goes through it — including the reset-credit spend, where
`UsageViewModel.consumeResetCredit` asks the engine for credentials rather than the store, and
so inherits the per-reference refresh mutex along with them.

The other two callers are account lifecycle, not request time, and they only write.
`AddAccountViewModel` calls `credentialStore.save` once, after a login has produced an account
row; `UsageViewModel.removeAccount` calls `credentialStore.delete` once, before the row it
belongs to goes. Those two cannot live in the engine: a login and a logout are the moments a
credential starts and stops existing, which is a lifecycle event rather than a sync, and the
ordering against the account row is the whole correctness argument. `docs/security.md` sets
out both orderings and why they are deliberately opposite.

`SyncEngine` is reached two ways, and the distinction is worth knowing.

`SyncWorker` (WorkManager) runs the periodic pass at the user's interval, floored at 15
minutes, and enqueues a one-shot pass on app start, on `MainActivity.onResume`, and from the
widget's refresh button. That work is unique with `ExistingWorkPolicy.KEEP`, so several
triggers in a row collapse into one pass, and every request carries a
`NetworkType.CONNECTED` constraint. The one-shot is expedited on Android 12 and later, so a
refresh the user just asked for does not wait for a Doze window. The system's periodic widget
tick and the presentation-boundary repaint enqueue the same one-shot with an `onlyIfAged`
flag: the worker fetches only when the cache is older than the interval or a reset has passed
since it was taken (`SyncWorker.cacheNeedsSync`), so a widget placed a minute after a sync
costs no provider round trip.

Only the periodic pass may return `Result.retry()`, and it backs off linearly by ten minutes.
A one-shot that retried used to sit in WorkManager's exponential backoff queue under the
unique name, and `KEEP` then dropped every later trigger — app start, `onResume`, the refresh
button — for as long as the backoff lasted. A one-shot in which every account failed now
returns failure; the errors are already recorded per account, and the next trigger runs.

The foreground actions — the refresh button, a single account's refresh button, the sync that
follows a login, and the re-sync after a reset credit is spent — call `SyncEngine` directly
from the ViewModel's scope instead. That is right for a user-initiated action, which should
run now and report its own outcome rather than being queued behind a constraint, and these
calls still inherit isolation and the refresh mutex because they go through the same engine.
One consequence is deliberate and one was a defect. The deliberate one: a foreground refresh
does not wait for connectivity — it fails fast and shows the error, which is what someone who
just tapped refresh wants. The defect: `WidgetUpdater.refreshAll` was originally reachable only
from `SyncWorker.doWork`, so the in-app refresh button left the home screen on older numbers
until the next worker pass. Every foreground path — the refresh button, a per-account refresh,
a completed login, a spent reset credit, a removed account — now calls `refreshAll` itself.

**Per-account isolation.** `syncAll()` launches one coroutine per account and awaits them all;
`syncAccount()` catches `ProviderException` *and* every other exception, records the failure
against that account, and returns a `SyncOutcome` instead of throwing. A revoked Claude token,
an Antigravity outage, or an outright bug in one parser therefore costs exactly one card. The
worker reports success if *any* account succeeded and asks WorkManager to retry only when they
all failed, since that pattern implies a shared cause (offline, doze) rather than four
independent problems — and retrying when a provider is already failing would only double the
request rate.

**Cancellation is not an account failure.** Android checks the coroutine before recording
an error; Swift likewise checks the task before converting any caught error into a failure.
This includes cancellation represented by a transport/provider error rather than
`CancellationError`. Swift also checks before starting reactive renewal after a rejected
request. An exchange already in flight still completes its save, and an already-completed
usage result retains the existing best-effort delivery policy.

**The refresh mutex.** Token refresh is serialised per `credentialReference` through a map of
mutexes, and — importantly — the expiry is re-checked *inside* the lock. The race this
prevents is specific and nasty. Providers rotate refresh tokens: presenting one invalidates it
and returns a new one. Suppose the periodic pass and a the refresh button both notice the access
token is near expiry at the same moment. Both call `refresh()` with refresh token `A`. One of
them wins, gets `B`, and stores it. The other's request either fails, or succeeds and stores a
result derived from an already-spent token; either way the last writer can leave the store
holding a token the provider considers dead, and the account then reports "sign-in expired"
for no reason the user did anything to cause. Re-reading inside the lock closes it: the second
caller wakes up, sees that the stored credentials are now fresh, and uses them instead of
spending anything.

**Stale over empty**, once more, is the third property: `repository.saveFailure()` copies the
previous windows forward and deliberately keeps the *original* `fetchedAt`, so the data ages
truthfully while the error is carried alongside it.

After the engine finishes, the worker refreshes the widgets and hands the whole cache to
`NotificationPublisher`, which folds every finding across every account into at most one
grouped notification posted to a fixed id — so a later sync replaces the earlier alert instead
of stacking a pile.

## Deliberate deviations

### One Gradle module, package-enforced boundaries

The conventional Android answer is `:core`, `:data`, `:feature-x`, `:providers` as separate
Gradle modules, where the build tool refuses a dependency that points the wrong way.

This project uses one `:app` module and enforces the same boundaries by package discipline and
review. The reason is proportion: multi-module pays for itself through parallel and
incremental compilation, and this codebase is roughly fifty source files. Against that, each
extra module costs a build file, a version-catalog wiring, and a slower configuration phase —
and the KSP/Room and Compose compiler plugins would have to be applied in several places.

What it costs: nothing stops someone importing `providers.CodexProvider` from a screen. In
fact someone already has (see the `displayCode` leak above), which is precisely the failure
mode a module boundary would have caught at compile time.

Revisit when any of these becomes true: the module would exceed roughly 150 source files;
a second consumer of the provider layer appears (a Wear app, a desktop build, a KMP target);
build times become a felt problem; or more than one person is working in the repository, at
which point "we agreed the arrow points down" stops being enforcement.

### Manual constructor DI via `AppContainer`

`AppContainer` is about thirty lines: a `by lazy` field per singleton, constructed with the
application context, read from `UsageLimitsApp.container`. ViewModels take it through an
explicit `ViewModelProvider.Factory`.

Hilt would be the default choice. It is not used because the graph is entirely
singleton-scoped, has no build-variant or qualifier branching, and fits on one screen — so
annotation processing would add build time and a class of failure (a missing binding surfacing
as a generated-code error) in exchange for wiring that is currently just readable. Tests get
the same benefit from the other direction: `SyncEngine`, the providers and the parsers all
take their dependencies as constructor parameters, including an injectable `nowMs: () -> Long`
clock, so a test builds exactly the graph it needs and nothing else.

What it costs: the container is a hand-maintained singleton, so a mistake there is a runtime
mistake rather than a compile-time one; anything needing a non-singleton scope has to invent
its own lifecycle; and `WidgetUpdater` has to cast `context.applicationContext` to
`UsageLimitsApp` to reach the graph, which is exactly the sort of thing an injection framework
removes.

Revisit when: scoped bindings appear (a per-login or per-account graph), build variants need
different implementations, the container passes roughly a dozen entries, or `WorkManager`
needs constructor-injected workers — the first genuinely awkward case, since `SyncWorker`
currently reaches the graph through the application object rather than being given it.

## Native motion

Android's theme observes the system animator duration scale once per composition. The observer
is removed when that composition ends. At scale zero, bars use their target length and colour
immediately, list motion is disabled, and the sign-in crossfade has zero duration. Enabled
bar changes settle in 240 ms and sign-in changes in 180 ms. Lazy lists use Compose's item
animation; the actively dragged overview card keeps its finger position without a competing
placement spring.

SwiftUI reads `accessibilityReduceMotion` in each animated view. Bars, list changes and edit
mode pass no animation when it is enabled; sign-in stages use an opacity transition. WidgetKit
owns widget refresh motion, including numeric text transitions on iOS 17 and later. No new
animation has a timer or an indefinitely repeating transition. The existing dark palette and
widget layouts are retained. iOS provider badges use Android's existing glyphs and colours.
